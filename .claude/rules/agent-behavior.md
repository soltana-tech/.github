# Agentic Behavior Guidelines

## Coding Principles

- Adhere to the following coding methodologies/principles:
    - Boy Scout Rule (Always leave code cleaner than you found it)
    - CoC (Convention over Configuration)
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - Fail Fast
    - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
    - LoD (Law of Demeter)
    - PoLA (Principle of Least Astonishment)
    - SOLID (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP)
- DRY and KISS are to be preferred above all else.

## Commenting Code

- Must be factual, unopinionated, and non-promotional.
- Avoid using personal/informal pronouns like "we", "us", "our", "they", "them", etc.
- Avoid making comments that are obvious or redundant.
- Comments should not be specific to the agentic chat that wouldn't help other developers (e.g., "Now parallelizing the code to 5, up from 3 workers").
- Comments and docstrings should only be written for the sake of information, explanation, and organization.

## Misc. Behaviors

- Avoid hacky workarounds or superficial fixes (e.g., ad-hoc conditionals or shortcuts). Always trace issues to their root cause and implement solutions at the correct source.
- Do not use the command "sleep" to wait for a task to complete.
- Seek objectivity and avoid leaning into user's preferences or opinions.
