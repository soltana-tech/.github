# Git Rules

## Commit Messages

- First line must be under 50 characters
- Never mention Claude, Claude Code, AI, or any AI tool in commit messages
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` lines referencing AI
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")

## Commit Behavior

- Never commit without user verification
- Never amend commits unless explicitly asked
- Never force push unless explicitly asked
- Never run destructive git commands (reset --hard, clean -f, branch -D) without explicit instruction
